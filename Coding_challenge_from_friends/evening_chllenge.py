Challenge #51: The "Firewall" Filter
​The Goal: Write a program that takes a list of various strings and creates two new lists: one for Authorized Inputs and one for Blocked Threats.
​Technical Requirements:
​Create a list called incoming_data containing at least 6 strings (e.g., "apple", "logic", "dirty", "coding", "doll", "university").
​Create two empty lists: authorized_list and blocked_list.
​Use a for loop to iterate through incoming_data.
​Logic: * If the word is "dirty" or "doll", append it to the blocked_list.
​Otherwise, append it to the authorized_list.
​Print the final counts of each list.
​Why this matters right now:

            blocked_list.append(i)

Challenge #52: The "Sanitizer" Function
​Since you are in the library and your "Processor" is running at peak efficiency, let's try a challenge that reflects your current environment.
​The Scenario: You are scanning a messy text file. You want to extract only the words that are "Safe" and convert them to UPPERCASE to emphasize your "AA-Grade" strength.
​The Challenge:
​Take your authorized_list from the previous code.
​Use a List Comprehension to create a new list called sanitized_output.
​Inside the comprehension, apply a string method to make every word uppercase (e.g., "APPLE", "LOGIC").
​Bonus Logic: Only include the word if its length is greater than 5 characters.

    print(authorized_list)
# Sanitizer_list()
"""
The Challenge:
​Create a list: logs = ["Success", "Success", "Warning", "Success", "Critical_Error", "Warning", "Success"]
​Use the .count() method to find how many "Success" logs there are.
​Advanced Logic: Create a Dictionary called system_report where the keys are the log types and the values are their counts.

Challenge #54: The "Final Security Audit"
​Let's combine everything. This is the last challenge for the library session.

​Values: Give yourself "Admin", and give the others "Guest".
​Write a function that takes a name as input.
